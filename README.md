- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DanieleIzzi95
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Graphic Design, Photography, Digital Retouching and Front-end web development.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning web development in Aulab
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: info.danieleizzi@gmail.com
- ðŸŽ¨ My passions and hobbies: movies and TV series, music, photography, technology, video games, and... fishing ðŸŽ£ !
- âš¡ Fun fact: "When I was attending the AANT (Academy of Arts and New Technologies in Rome), I hated the web design course. Now I'm madly in love with front-end development, especially after realizing that I could combine my passion for photography, graphic design, and website design.
Sometimes life is strange!"
